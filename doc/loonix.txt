__FLAT-OS__

This is simply a small kernel, made to run a small collection of programs. It's not much, and I don't expect it ever will be.

__GOALS__

I want to run some programs, on a tiny kernel written in C

__SOURCE__

All source will be licensed under the GPL. Lots of the code is modified source from osdev.org, and I will be giving credit where credit is due.

The Source Tree:
	src/
		kernel files
		header/
			header files
		bin/
			programs
		initramfs/
			initrd and ramdisk packing utilities
		build/
			where the finished kernel is located after make'ing it

Files that should never be touched:
	kheap.c
	paging.c
	ordered_array.c

These all use very fragile codebases based around a lot of conversions between (unsigned int) and (void*)

__CODING_CONVENTIONS__

-No camel case, all underscore style
-ALWAYS space between math operators and arguments
-Avoid uneccessary brackets

__INITRAMFS__

The initramfs will be following a format I created named FFS (Flat File System). See FFS.txt for more information.

__DISK_IO__

Disk drivers should be added later on, but for the time being, there are none.

__NETWORKING__

There is pretty much no chance there will be networking, but I'll see what I can do.
